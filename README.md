# SQLAlchemy-challenge

Overview

This project analyzes climate data from an SQLite database using Python libraries such as SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The analysis focuses on retrieving temperature and precipitation data, identifying trends, and visualizing the results.

Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

SQLAlchemy (ORM and database connection)

Pandas (data analysis)

Matplotlib (data visualization)

NumPy (numerical computations)

Data Source

The project uses climate data stored in the SQLite database hawaii.sqlite. The key tables in the database are:

Measurement: Contains temperature and precipitation data.

Station: Contains information about weather stations.

Key Analysis Tasks

Reflect Tables into SQLAlchemy ORM

Use SQLAlchemy to connect to the database and map the tables.

Precipitation Analysis

Query the last 12 months of precipitation data.

Convert the data into a Pandas DataFrame and plot a bar chart.

Station Analysis

Identify the most active station (i.e., the one with the most temperature observations).

Retrieve and analyze temperature data for this station.

Temperature Analysis

Query the last 12 months of temperature data for the most active station.

Plot the data using a histogram.

Instructions

Install required dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas sqlalchemy matplotlib

Open the Jupyter Notebook (climate_starter.ipynb).

Run each cell sequentially to connect to the database and generate visualizations.

Interpret the results to understand climate trends.

Results

Precipitation Analysis: Shows trends in rainfall over the last 12 months.

Temperature Trends: Histogram displays the frequency of temperature observations.

Station Insights: Identifies the station with the most recorded temperature data.

Author

This project was developed as part of a data analysis exercise using SQLAlchemy and Matplotlib.
